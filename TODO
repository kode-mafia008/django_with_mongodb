---

### **3. Databases – PostgreSQL**

* ✅ **pg_dump / pg_restore** usage
* ✅ **Joins**: inner, left, right, full, cross
* ✅ **Views, materialized views, indexes, constraints**
* ✅ **Transactions, locks, isolation levels**
* ✅ **Performance tuning**: `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`, indexing strategies, query optimization
* ✅ **JSON fields & PostgreSQL functions (`->`, `->>`, `jsonb_set`)**
* ✅ **Schema migrations with Django (South/Migrations system)**

---

### **4. Redis**

* ✅ **Caching strategies**:

  * Page caching, fragment caching, low-level cache API
  * Redis as Django cache backend
* ✅ **Pub/Sub and Queues (Celery/Temporal usage)**
* ✅ **Rate limiting / Throttling using Redis**
* ✅ **Storing sessions in Redis**

---

### **5. Task Orchestration & Workflow Systems**

* ✅ **Celery** (you already noted this): retries, chaining, periodic tasks
* ✅ **Temporal** (important here):

  * Concepts: Workflow, Activity, Task Queue, Worker
  * Temporal vs Celery comparison
  * Python SDK overview
  * Reliability and retry semantics
  * Long-running workflows and signals

---

### **6. AWS & DevOps Basics**

* ✅ **AWS S3** – boto3 basics, pre-signed URLs, permissions, storage backends
* ✅ **AWS EC2** – deployment, environment setup
* ✅ **AWS IAM** – access management (for S3 and EC2 roles)
* ✅ **Docker** – Dockerfile optimization, docker-compose, networking
* ✅ **Basic CI/CD** – GitHub Actions or similar
* ✅ **Logging & Monitoring** – AWS CloudWatch, Django logging configuration

---

### **7. Caching & Performance**

* ✅ **Django caching framework** (File-based, Memcached, Redis)
* ✅ **Query optimization** (minimizing ORM calls, lazy vs eager loading)
* ✅ **N+1 problem and how to avoid it**
* ✅ **Scaling strategies**: horizontal vs vertical scaling
* ✅ **Load testing tools** (Locust, k6 basics)

---

### **8. Authentication & Security**

* ✅ **JWT internals** – structure, signature validation, expiration
* ✅ **Firebase Authentication flow** (verifying ID tokens server-side)
* ✅ **Session-based auth and CSRF protection**
* ✅ **Django Security Best Practices**:

  * `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, `SECURE_*` settings
  * XSS, CSRF, Clickjacking prevention
  * Password hashing (`PBKDF2`, `Argon2`)
* ✅ **OAuth2 / Social Auth basics**

---

### **9. Software Engineering Practices**

* ✅ **Version control (Git)** – branching, PRs, conflict resolution
* ✅ **Async collaboration tools** (e.g. working with distributed teams)
* ✅ **Using AI tools like Claude / Copilot effectively**
* ✅ **Code reviews and writing maintainable code**
* ✅ **Design Patterns in Python/Django** (Singleton, Repository, Factory, etc.)

---

### **10. Domain Knowledge (Bonus)**

* ✅ **Logistics & Supply Chain Basics**

  * Shipment lifecycle (Order → Dispatch → Delivery)
  * Inventory management concepts
  * Workflow orchestration relevance (Temporal use-case here)
* ✅ **System Design for logistics**

  * Event-driven architecture
  * Handling large datasets
  * Caching and eventual consistency in distributed systems

---

### **11. Miscellaneous (High-Impact but Often Missed)**

* ✅ **Testing async code and Celery tasks**
* ✅ **Database migrations and data migrations**
* ✅ **Using `pytest-django`**
* ✅ **Integration with external APIs (REST, Webhooks, etc.)**
* ✅ **Async Django (`asgiref`, `channels`)**
* ✅ **Performance profiling** (`django-silk`, `debug-toolbar`)

---

### ✅ **Final Suggested Prep Order**

1. Django (ORM, Auth systems, Views, REST, Signals)
2. PostgreSQL (Joins, Transactions, Optimizations)
3. Redis + Caching
4. Celery / Temporal (compare + architecture)
5. AWS S3 + DevOps basics
6. Advanced Python (Asyncio, Coroutines, Decorators)
7. Security + Scaling
8. Domain understanding (Logistics, workflow orchestration)

Would you like me to make this into a **structured 7-day preparation roadmap** (with daily topic focus + practical exercises)?
That’d make it easier to systematically prepare before the interview.
